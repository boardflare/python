    "Uses the [Azure AI Language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/sentiment-opinion-mining/overview?tabs=prebuilt) service to analyze sentiment and opinions in the provided documents. It returns an array containing the sentiment analysis results with sentiment polarity at the document, sentence, and aspect levels. It also provides the opinions used at the aspect level.\n",

    "| All sentences in the document are `neutral`. | `neutral` |\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence scores range from 1 to 0. Scores closer to 1 indicate a higher confidence in the label's classification, while lower scores indicate lower confidence. For each document or each sentence, the predicted scores associated with the labels (positive, negative, and neutral) add up to 1. For more information, see the Responsible AI transparency note.\n",
