# AI Ask

## Overview

This function interacts with an AI model (specifically designed for chat completions, compatible with OpenAI's API structure) to generate text-based responses based on a given prompt. It can optionally incorporate data provided as a 2D list into the prompt for more context-specific analysis or generation.

## Usage

Sends a `prompt` and optional `data` to an AI model and returns the generated text response.

```excel
=AI_ASK(prompt, [data], [temperature], [max_tokens], [model])
```

Arguments:

| Argument      | Type           | Description                                                                                                | Default         |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `prompt`      | string         | The question, task, or instruction for the AI.                                                             |                 |
| `data`        | 2D list        | Optional: Data from an Excel range to be included in the context sent to the AI.                           | `None`          |
| `temperature` | float          | Optional: Controls the randomness/creativity of the response (0.0 to 2.0). Higher values mean more creative. | `0.5`           |
| `max_tokens`  | int            | Optional: Maximum number of tokens (words/subwords) the AI should generate in its response.                | `250`           |
| `model`       | string         | Optional: The specific AI model ID to use for the request (e.g., 'mistral-small', 'mistral-large').        | `mistral-small` |

Returns:

| Return Value | Type   | Description                                  |
|--------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| Response     | string | The text response generated by the AI model. |
