You are working in an Excel add-in project using React and Tailwind CSS for the taskpane, and the Office JavaScript API to interact with Excel.  The project enables the user to run Python code using Pyodide through either a custom function or by directly inserting the result into a worksheet cell.  Do not make changes to anything unrelated to the request.
