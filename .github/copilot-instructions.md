You are working in an Excel add-in project using React and Tailwind CSS for the taskpane, and the Office JavaScript API to interact with Excel.  The project enables the user to run Python code using Pyodide through either a custom function or by directly inserting the result into a worksheet cell.

Some things to keep in mind when working on the project:
- When editing a specification document, do not make changes to any code files used as references.
- Put snippets of key api calls in the specification, but do not include complete code.
- When using Excel APIs, check the documentation here https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs-reference/tree/main/docs/docs-ref-autogen/excel_1_18/excel to confirm the correct usage.
