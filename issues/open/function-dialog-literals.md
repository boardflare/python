# Specification: Refactor FunctionDialog for Excel Literals in Argument Inputs

## Overview
Refactor the FunctionDialog component to enable users to input Excel literal expressions (e.g., numbers, arrays, dates) into argument fields. The component should validate and convert these literals using Excel's native evaluation engine.

## Requirements
- **Literal Detection and Conversion:**
  - On input field blur, trigger a new `validateLiteral` function.
  - The function will write the input as a formula (e.g., prepend "=") to a temporary worksheet cell.
  - After synchronizing with Excel, read the evaluated value and update the input field with the converted literal.

- **Integration:**
  - Integrate the literal validation with existing onBlur and onFocus events in FunctionDialog.
  - Maintain current behavior for range selections, ensuring that literal inputs and range references work in harmony.

- **Error Handling:**
  - If Excel encounters an error evaluating the literal, log the error and leave the original input unmodified (or provide a suitable fallback).
  - Ensure graceful degradation if the evaluation fails (e.g., user feedback through error messages).

- **Performance and Synchronization:**
  - Minimize delays caused by repeated Excel.run calls.
  - Avoid conflicts between literal evaluation and range selection functionality.

## Potential Issues
- **Performance Overhead:**
  - Frequent Excel.run calls may introduce latency especially on complex literals. Consider debouncing or batch handling if necessary.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Not every literal string might be interpreted correctly by Excel.
  - Complex expressions or ambiguous literals may cause unexpected behavior.

- **User Experience:**
  - Users need clear feedback if the literal conversion fails.
  - Changes should be intuitive and must not override valid range selections.

## Implementation Notes
- Introduce a new asynchronous function `validateLiteral` in FunctionDialog.jsx.
- Use a designated temporary cell (e.g., A1 on a dedicated hidden worksheet or an agreed location) for literal evaluation.
- Ensure the refactored code maintains existing functionality while enabling Excel literal conversion.
